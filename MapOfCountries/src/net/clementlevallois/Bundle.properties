    The note attached to the dataset says:<br>\n<br>\n"Use this dataset with care, as several of the borders are disputed.\
    <br>\n<br>\nThe original shapefile (world_borders.zip, 3.2 MB) was downloaded from the Mapping Hacks website:<br>\nhttp://www.mappinghacks.com/data <br>\n<br>\nThe dataset was derived by Schuyler Erle from public domain sources.\
    <br>\nSean Gilles did some clean up and made some enhancements."\
