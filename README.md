#Plugins for Gephi


In this repository I list the plugins I created for Gephi.

##1. Alphabetical Sorter
This plugin is helpful to neatly sort and put apart isolated nodes floating around, before an export to SVG or PNG.

##2. Force Atlas 3D

Force Atlas 2 is a layout for Gephi created by Mathieu Jacomy et al., scalable to 10,000 nodes and more.  

Force Atlas *3D* extends it to 3 dimensions instead of 2.  

##3. Maps of Countries

Take a country, continent or the entire world map and display in with Gephi. Useful to serve as a background for geolocalized networks.
