#Plugins for Gephi


In this repository I list the plugins I created for Gephi.

##1. Alphabetical Sorter
This plugin is helpful to nearly sort and put apart isolated nodes floating around, before an export to SVG or PNG.

##2. Force Atlas 3D

Force Atlas 2 is a layout for Gephi created by Mathieu Jacomy et al., scalable to 10,000 nodes and more.  

Force Atls *3D* extends it to 3 dimensions instead of 2.
